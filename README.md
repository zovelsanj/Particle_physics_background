This repo is a self-studied documentation of a few available preliminary requisites for particle physics.
It contains documentation of theoretical background for particle physics including linear and abstract algebra with topology theory,
along with `C++` and `Python` codes to analyze the `ROOT` data obtained from detectors at the **LHC**.
