This repo is a self-studied documentation of a few available preliminary requisites for particle physics.
It contains some documentations of theoretical background for particle physics (including linear and abstract algebra with topology theory) and references
along with `C++` and `Python` codes to analyze the `ROOT` data using [ROOT library]([url](https://root.cern/doc/v636/index.html)) of CERN.
